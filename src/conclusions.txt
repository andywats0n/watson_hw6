We sampled over 500 cities and plotted specific weather attributes against their longitude to see
what correlations may exist.

The graphs in the provided notebook show temperature increasing as you near the earth's equator (0 deg lng),
cloud coverage and wind speer are mostly indistinguishable at different longitudes,
and there is a sharp increase in humidity right at the equator.
